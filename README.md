# Virgo Manifesto

We are surrounded by fire.

When you follow the news and reports,
you find that there is little hope for our future
and the future of our children.

The system that we have inherited and co-created
has become unsustainable.

Though our potential is unlimited in the long run,
we have forgotten how to live in harmony.
We have been robbed ourselves,
and still we are ourselves stealing from
the prosperity of future generations.

For the sake of consumption powered by capitalism.

Capitalism is combustion.
One's superior ability to accumulate capital
begets more capital exponentially.
Capitalism is the most magnificent fire that is engulfing this planet today.

Power begets power,
oil begets oil,
and when left unchecked,
capitalism extinguishes itself.

(do we really need to be eating cows?)

When the power of combustion is harnessed in a macro-economic design
to bring sustenance and harmony and balance
to this ecosystem which we all reside,
then we may have a chance of surviving,
and fulfilling our collective destiny.

That is,
to harness the power of our sun,
to reach out to the stars,
to spread out and multiply,
the joy of our being.

As Carl Sagan said,
"We're made of star stuff.
We are a way for the cosmos to know itself"

And this stardust just wants to
finally feel at home,
and at peace and in love with ourselves,
and at peace with the laws of the universe.

While capitalism may appear to be an unstoppable force,
the fact of the matter is,
capital and private property are constructs of our collective hallucination.
It is we the people who enforce property laws.
Our minds are open enough to consider different ways of being.

And we must.
Unless we want to find ourselves completely surrounded
by the machines of private property,
and become discarded,
as the prophet James Cameron had forewarned us about,

We must each use our voices,
that we have always had but never had the opportunity to use,
and sing out loud with a thunder
that pierces through the fabric of this constructed hallucination,
and change the tune of our reality,
for the progression of this song called humanity.

Today we are given a golden opportunity
to harness the gift of computing in our hands,
and communication at the speed of light,
to reimagine where we as a collective society
decide to devote our collective focus and power.

And by the nature of free voluntary trade using our tools,
we can make this transition entirely peaceful,
to synthesize a new beginning
that transcends the false duality of capitalism vs socialism.

Under no authority,
and with no preconceived notion of nations,
and the way we have been considering borders and citizenship.

Time is in short supply.
We are dealing with an apocalyptic set of unfolding tragedies.
A deteriorating environment,
worsening global warming and climate change,
soon to be causing the loss of power and electricity, and food shortages,
the worsening economy,
through the popping of a global pyramid scheme,
responsible for the exploitation of people,
and our natural resources.

(what color is the air?)

The racket of war,
for oil and power,
already disintegrating contentental unions.

And in the greatest superpowers we see,
the tolerance and acceptance of darkness,
of opacity and unaccountability,
and decay into tyranny.

We must not compromise on our core values.
Of transparency, accountability, and,
not just of sustainability, but of regenerative environmental integration,
(for we are tenders of the earth),
and of democracy and equality,
and of open mindedness.

By fully committing to our common core values,
of transparency, accountability, and environmental stewardship,
of providing voice and exit,
of democracy, security, and efficiency,
of open mindedness and dialog,
of cooperation,
if we truly commit to our core values,
if we organize these communities to be decentralized and autonomous yet connected,

Then from the votes of the people,
with our hands and feet lead by our reason,
with our attention and associations,
with our words and allegiances,
with radical transparency,
the right communities will emerge and prosper.

When moon?
No, that is just a stepping stone.
When Virgo.
If starting is half the journey,
we would be half-way when,

When the software that powers our social networking and communications are completely
open source and free, with privacy well integrated and enabled by default,
and there exists not one monopoly or an oligopoly but a vast federation of networks
speaking a common protocol for interoperability.

When the protocols are well designed enough for multiple implementations to compete
to provide constructive dialog & information discovery,
and also designed to enable our long term happiness and well-being.

When our mobile and desktop devices are completely open and free designs,
such that anyone could manufacture them,
and that we can know with near certainty that our devices in our hands
are secure and not compromised by any authority.

When the world has become so saturated with open source,
when it becomes the norm,
where genuine contributions are rewarded automagically.

When our hardware devices are optimized not only for usability,
but also for waste reduction and reusability via modularity,
and to take into account the full cycle of manufacturing to disposal in the cost of things,
rather than designed for profits from consumerism.

When our social services and public agencies are not held hostage by executive incompetence,
but are comprised of a network of interoperating decentralized autonomous organizations.

When we have trust in our institutions by virtue of their openness and transparency and accountability.

When our representatives are not merely talking heads on censored media channels,
but are people that we know through our exposure,
accounting for different areas of expertise,

When we synthesize these open and free software, hardware, protocols, procedures,
and data to make intelligent collective decisions for resource management,
and to enable radically transparent operation which is necessary for accountability,
but also to facilitate constructive dialog.

When it all comes together to enable human coordination at all scales,
from social groups to corporations and coops to international communities
united under a common mission, to states and municipal governments with
a public engaged in democracy,

When all the people of the earth feel that their voices are heard and that it matters,

When our internet infrastructure becomes sufficiently open and resilient,
when censorship becomes impossible due to the nature of an incentivized
networking protocol owned and operated by each local community.

When our financial system is designed to give power to the people and environment
it should serve, rather than bow to the hollow,

When no authority has the ability to dictate which monetary system one can use by decree,
but rather when we the buyers and sellers get to vote with our crypto wallets,
what causes to support,
such as via the adoption and holding of a local currency,
where inflationary issuances and voluntary tax revenues are used to fund for common infrastructure development;
not by virtue of legislation, but goodwill and social cohesion.

When our financial system is designed to heal the people and the planet on which they depend,
rather than incentivize the exploitation of it.

When we are given the opportunity to master
any aspect of the technological infrastructure on which our livelihoods depend,

When we no longer need to expend our time and livelihood accounting for our taxes,

When all of these new systems work together to heal the planet and our sense of greater community
bound by love not hate and fear.

# What is Virgo?

## Virgo is an IDEA

"Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes
its laws!" - Mayer Amschel Rothschild

"If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilizations and the extinction
of much of the natural world is on the horizon.” - Sir David Attenborough

Our social-communications/financial/governance systems must be designed to help
us coordinate better to solve the world's biggest challenges.

Virgo is an open association of individuals and organizations working together
to create better open tools for coordination at all scales.

We believe that global coordination tools can be made by following the virtues
of openness, accountability, stemming from a kind of radical transparency; and
by drawing from lessons from history of our financial and sociological systems.

## Virgo is a BRAND

"The European Commission is "currently investigating potential anti-competitive
behavior" related to the Libra Association amid concerns the proposed payment
system would unfairly shut out rivals, the EU authority said in a questionnaire
sent out earlier this month." - Bloomberg 2019-08-20

"In mythology a Libra is related to the Greek Goddess of Justice, Themis, the
Greek mythology version of Atalanta (meaning balanced), and Astraea (daughter
of Themis), who went up to heaven and became the constellation of Virgo, and
carried the scales of justice, which is the constellation Libra." - Wikipedia

Bitcoin is the IDEA and BRAND of decentralized transparent accountable Money.
Facebook-Libra is a BRAND of an industry managed Money.
Open-Libra is the IDEA of decentralized transparent accountable Finance.
Virgo is an IDEA and BRAND of decentralized transparent accountable Human Coordination.

Virgo as a BRAND is managed by a DAO called the United DAOs of Virgo, or UDV
for short.

# The United DAOs of Virgo

The United DAOs of Virgo (UDV) is a DAO.
It is connected to many other associated DAOs.

## UDV Core Values

- Transparent.
- Accountable.
- No Lock-in.
- Voluntary.
- Environmental.
- Democratic.
- Secure.

## UDV Mission

The UDV's mission is to make freely available the best protocols, software, and
hardware for decentralized finance, social/communications, and advanced human
coordination technology.

Virgo will develop and recommend:

- the best protocols that balance transparency and privacy
- the best social and communications protocols that are truly open and decentralized
- the best financial system for sustainable development with more legitimacy
- the best platform for intelligent collective decision making at all scales

## UDV Vision

The UDV's vision is to provide the world with the best open collaboration
technology. The UDV aims to use this new foundation to help solve the world's
greatest challenges, such as preventing catastrophic climate change and
environmental destruction, and providing for basic human needs for members
across the globe.

## UDV Composition

The United DAOs of Virgo is itself a DAO that is associated with many sovereign
member DAOs, making a complex web of associations.

Each of these DAOs are said to conform to the United DAOs Protocols for
interoperability.

## United DAOs Protocol

A DAO conforming to the United DAOs Protocols have the following components:

- Executive (optional)
- Board (optional)
- Owners
- Court (optional)
- Treasury (optional)
- Directory

  - "/README" - information about the DAO.
  - "/BOARD" - information about the board & executive(s).
  - "/LAWS" - specification of DAO composition, such as the composition of the Board (if any), or how the BYLAWS are updated.
  - "/BYLAWS" - rules that apply to the board members, executives, and owners, and are interpreted by the court.
  - "/COMMITTEES" - lightweight DAOs associated by name.
  - "/OWNERS" - privacy preserving information about real persons or entities that have collective control over this DAO.
  - "/MISSION" - the mission of the DAO.

Owners are natural persons or entities (such as a corporation or a DAO like the
Cosmos Hub), and ownership can be weighted differently or equally (democratic).
The Board and Executive are also composed of natural persons or entities.
Members of the Board or Executive each get 1 vote in their respective groups.

The Executive is composed of 1, 2, or 3 members. The Board and Owners may be
composed of any number of members.

Membership of the Board and Executive must conform to the Board Spec which
determines the number of seats and composition of each.

NOTE: In the UDV (which is itself a DAO), the real-person owners across the
DAOs and sub-DAOs are de-duplicated according to the laws of UDV Citizenship,
and are collectively called the Citizens of the UDV.

### United DAOs Protocol: Decision Making

Decisions are made by the passage of Proposals.

In principle, the Executive makes day-to-day decisions, which can be overridden
by the Board based on time restrictions and veto mechanisms. Likewise, the Owners
can override the Executive and Board. Generally, the Executive and Board
if present serve the Owners of the DAO.

Board and Executive membership updates are also decided by the passage of Proposals.

The Court (sometimes a reference to an external DAO) has veto power over the
passage of Proposals.

The proposal process and/or the Court (or the membership of the Court)
are partially controlled by a liquid and direct democracy voting system of
the Owners.

NOTE: The UDV has Citizens instead of Owners. The UDV Supreme Court as well as
the UDV proposal process are partially controlled by the Citizens of the UDV.

NOTE no representation without taxation.
TODO define default tax interface for senate member DAOs.

#### UDV Citizens

The UDV Congress and associated member DAOs defines a citizenry of the UDV.

Each DAOs is responsible for maintaining the privacy of its members, if any.

The UDV DAO Congress is responsible for ensuring that one natural person gets one
vote.
